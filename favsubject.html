                        <dd>
                            Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems 
                            in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today's digital 
                            world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. 
                            New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
                            Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

                     Data Structures & Algorithms:
                        <dd>
                            A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. 
                            For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform 
                            computations on the data. A data structure is a named location that can be used 
                            to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve 
                            a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write
                            efficient and optimized computer programs.

                     HTML:
                        <dd>
                            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents 
                            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such 
                            as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers 
                            receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
                            into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
                            originally included cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
                            With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
